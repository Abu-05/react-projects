# React Learning Journey 🚀

This repository contains my hands-on learning and practice with **modern React**.  
I am building projects step by step while strengthening my fundamentals in JavaScript and React.

The focus of this repository is **learning by building**, not copy-paste tutorials.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- React (Functional Components)
- React Hooks  
  - useState  
  - useEffect  
  - useContext  
  - useReducer  
  - useRef  
- React Router
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML & CSS
- Git & GitHub

---

## 📌 What I Have Implemented So Far

- Component-based architecture
- Props and state management
- Event handling
- Conditional rendering
- Dynamic lists with keys
- API fetching using `useEffect`
- Parent ↔ Child communication
- Global state using Context API
- Complex state handling using `useReducer`
- Custom Hooks (`useToggle`, `useFetch`, `useLocalStorage`)
- Basic routing using React Router

## 📂 Projects / Features

- **Todo App (useReducer)**
  - Add, remove, toggle todos
  - Clean reducer-based logic
- **API Fetching Example**
  - Data fetching with loading state
- **Context API Demo**
  - Global user state across components
- **Custom Hooks Practice**
  - Reusable logic for real-world use cases

(More projects coming soon 🚧)

## Completed Projects
## ✅ Advanced Todo App

A fully functional Todo application built with modern React patterns.

### Features
- Add, edit, delete todos
- Toggle completed state
- Filter todos (All / Active / Completed)
- Persist data using localStorage
- Reducer-based state management
- Component-level styling using CSS Modules

### Concepts Used
- useReducer
- useState
- useEffect
- Derived state
- CSS Modules
- Clean component architecture


## 🔐 Authentication App

A simple authentication system built using React to understand how login
flows, protected routes, and state persistence work in real applications.

### 🚀 Features
- Login with email and password
- Authentication state managed using React Context
- Protected routes using React Router
- Login state persisted using localStorage
- Clean and minimal UI
- Proper component structure

### 🧠 What I Learned
- How authentication works in frontend applications
- Using Context API for global state
- Protecting routes in React
- Managing side effects and persistence
- Debugging routing and rendering issues
- Structuring React projects cleanly

### 🧪 Test Credentials
Email: admin@test.com
Password: 1234

## 🌦️ Weather App

A weather application built using React and the Open-Meteo API.

### Features
- Search weather by city name
- Or you can just click "My location" button to know your area weather details
- Real-time weather data
- No API key required
- Loading and error handling
- Clean component structure

### What I Learned
- Working with public APIs
- Handling async operations in React
- Managing UI states (loading, error, success)
- Splitting logic into reusable components

### Tech Stack
- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Open-Meteo API
